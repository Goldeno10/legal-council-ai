2. Document Ingestion (The "Staff" Level Parsers)
Standard PDF readers won't cut it for legal docs. Docling (IBM) is the current industry leader for layout-aware parsing.

# Docling for high-fidelity PDF-to-Markdown
pip install docling

# Microsoft Presidio for the PII/Privacy scrubbing layer
pip install docling presidio-analyzer presidio-anonymizer spacy
python -m spacy download en_core_web_lg


3. Vector Database & RAG
For the rag_pipeline.py to handle semantic search and clause retrieval.
bash
# ChromaDB is the best local-first vector store for legal privacy
pip install chromadb 

# Sentence Transformers for high-quality local embeddings
pip install sentence-transformers huggingface_hub
Use code with caution.

4. Production API & Infrastructure
To run the main.py and handle the streaming responses.
bash
pip install fastapi uvicorn python-multipart pydantic-settings
Use code with caution.



Pro-Tip for Local Performance:
When running locally, legal documents can be heavy. I recommend downloading the llama3.2:3b for the Translator (fast) and mistral:7b or llama3.1:8b for the Extractor/Analyzer (more accurate).
